		a) Select Alternate Function in MODER Register
		b) Select Open Drain Output 
		c) Select High SPEED for the PINs
		d) Select Pull-up for both the Pins
		e) Configure the Alternate Function in AFR Register
	3. Reset the I2C 	
	4. Program the peripheral input clock in I2C_CR2 Register in order to generate correct timings
	5. Configure the clock control registers
	6. Configure the rise time register
	7. Program the I2C_CR1 register to enable the peripheral
